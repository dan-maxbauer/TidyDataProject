# Read Me 

The R code in run_analysis.R performs the following analysis:

1. Merges test and train datasets to form one dataframe
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviations for each measurment variable
3. Modifies variable names to be descriptive
4. Substitutes activity labels in place of numerical codes 
5. Calculates the mean for each measurement variable grouped by subject and activity
6. Produces final output "tidyoutput.txt" that contains means as described in 5.
